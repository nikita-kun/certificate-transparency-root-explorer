Certificate Transparency Root Explorer

This tool allows you to visualize current root stores of Certificate Transparency Logs, explore their intersections, parse, search and export certificate information.

Requirements: Chrome or Chromium Browser.

By default, only Google's logs are listed, since the rest of the logs have not explicitly configured their servers with permissive CORS policies.

AT YOUR OWN RISK: To be able to fetch other logs you have to disable CORS same-origin policy and/or other security features of your browser, such as TLS certificate verification. Please, use in a safe, non-production environment in case you want to disable security features of your browser.

Debug output could be found in the console.
